I am a mathematician, with background in nonlinear---especially convex, nonsmooth, and set-valued---analysis and optimization; interest in control theory, including optimal control, and dynamical systems; and interdisciplinary experience in control engineering. 
My research is, broadly, in the development and application of tools in convex, or nonsmooth, or set-valued analysis to problems in control theory and dynamical systems, especially those inspired by or with relevance in control engineering.  
One more specific research area is generalized dynamical systems, which may be multivalued and which may be hybrid, i.e., which may feature both continuous-time dynamics and discrete-time dynamics.
